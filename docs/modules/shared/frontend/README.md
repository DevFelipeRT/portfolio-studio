# Shared (Frontend)

There is no dedicated “Shared” frontend module that mirrors `app/Modules/Shared`.

Frontend shared utilities live under other folders (for example `resources/js/common/`, `resources/js/components/`), while `app/Modules/Shared` is a backend-only cross-cutting layer used by PHP modules.
